    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
      The City is required to notify the public of countless projects every day - from film shootings to permit
      applications to tree removals to construction work. In fact, there are around 17 different City agencies that
      collectively issue dozens of public notices of some kind every day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, these notices are often only posted via physical signs or leaflets, and can vary widely in their content
      and procedures across departments.
    </p>

    <p>
      This structure makes it difficult for residents to understand the status and nature of City projects at any given
      time, which can lead to complaints that cost the City time and money and reduce public trust in government.

    <p>
      In response, the Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance to create a centralized electronic notification system
      that would allow the viewing of and the subscription to push notifications. The City created a role, working within
      the SF Digital Services team to coordinate the research, design, and building of a system, using human centered
      design principles, to improve City noticing.
